## 2. About this setup:

This is a react app running postCSS and tailwind. 

- Tailwind was used to decrease startup time to get a workable UI, allowing me to focus more effort on handling the API calls and data processing. I personally like to use utility based css styles, I've written my own libraries and used pre-built ones over my career and Tailwind is usefull because of it's strong documentation and blank slate

# Todo App README:

## 1. Commands:

### To Start
In the project directory, the following commands will install dependencies and launch the app:
`npm i`
`npm start`
App should launch to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

### Running Tests
There are very limited tests written, only against a couple helper functions in src/utils/tests, this command will launch the test runner:
`npm test`

## 2. About this setup:

This is built with React, styles are mainly handleed with TailwindCSS. 

- Tailwind was used to decrease startup time to get a workable UI while I focused more of my challenge time on the functionality. I personally like to use utility based css, I've written my own libraries and used pre-built ones over my career and Tailwind is useful because of it's strong documentation and quick start.
